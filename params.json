Thus it must be possible with this API to write an AR Drone application without having to understand the drone’s specifications. \r\n\r\n## Services\r\nThe API will provide five main services: \r\n*\tManaging the connection and data transmission between the drone and the smartphone. The UDP protocol will be used in order to set up a link between the devices.\r\n*\tGenerating the commands that will be sent to the drone. These are AT commands that require a specific syntax.\r\n*\tSetting up the drone before take-off (such as setting the maximum altitude, video frame rate…).\r\n*\tReceiving and interpreting the navigation data coming from the drone in order to display useful information such as altitude and speed of the aircraft.\r\n*\tReceiving the video streamed by the drone in order to display it in real time. It will also be possible to record the video stream.\r\n\r\nThus this interface will allow the user to set up and pilot the drone. It will also allow him to display and record the camera stream, which can be used for further processing.\r\n\r\n## How to install\r\n\r\n1. Download and unzip \"AR-Drone-2.0.zip\"\r\n2. Open the project in Android Studio\r\n3. Compile the project into your smartphone\r\n4. Power up the drone and connect your smartphone to its WiFi hotspot\r\n5. You're good to go\r\n\r\n## Libraries dependencies\r\n\r\n* [Vitamio] (https://vitamio.org/) is used to display the drone's video feed in real time. \r\n\r\n## What's included\r\nYou will find in this repository all the Java classes, as well as an Android project that can be used as an example.\r\n\r\n## Authors\r\nWe are [Electrical Engineering and Industrial Programming Students] (https://www.iut-acy.univ-smb.fr/) at the [University of Savoie Mont-Blanc] (https://www.univ-smb.fr/).\r\n* [Jules Simon] (https://github.com/JulesSimonGEII)\r\n* Alexis Artigues\r\n* Mathieu Collomb\r\n* Antoine Crosetti\r\n* Jean-Christophe Chudziak\r\n\r\n## Mentor\r\n\r\n* Bernard Caron\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
